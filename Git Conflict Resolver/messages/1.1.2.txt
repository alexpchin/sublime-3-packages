Changes in 1.1.2
====================

Add a new command `Keep Common Ancestor` which is especially designed for the `diff3` conflict type in Git.

A little example from the Git documentation:

	Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
	ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed.
	<<<<<<< yours:sample.txt
	Conflict resolution is hard;
	let's go shopping.
	|||||||
	Conflict resolution is hard.
	=======
	Git makes conflict resolution easy.
	>>>>>>> theirs:sample.txt
	And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

Git Conflict Resolver will match on "Conflict resolution is hard." as the common ancestor.

Enjoy!
