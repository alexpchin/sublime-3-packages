Changes in 1.3.0
================

Added live gutter marks for the conflict groups!

You will now be able to easily distinguish the different groups (ours, theirs, common ancestor):

* `Ours` left arrow
* `Theirs` right arrow
* `Common ancestor` minus

As usual you can disable this feature via the settings-file:

{
	...

	// This options enable the gutter marks for the different conflict groups
	"ours_gutter": true,
	"theirs_gutter": true,
	"ancestor_gutter": true
}

Enjoy!
