Changes in 1.4.0
================

Features
--------

Added a "Show Conflict Files" feature.

In case of conflicts in your repository you can use this feature to list all files containing conflicts; this enables you to quickly find relevant files to fix the conflicts and continue with your work.

Since this functionality uses git to find any conflicts in your repository Git Conflict Resolver now needs to know where to find your git executable.
In the case you don't have git in your path you can use the "git_path" setting to tell the plugin where to find git.

By default "Show Conflict Files" only displays the filename without any path segments (so "src/main.js" will become "main.js"), you can disable this behaviour with the "show_only_filenames" setting.

Bugfixes
--------

- Using "Find Next Conflict" multiple times will jump to the next conflict instead of always finding the first conflict in the file
- Trying to pick an empty block in a conflict (speaks deletions) will work as expected and remove the whole conflict instead of doing nothing

Enjoy!
