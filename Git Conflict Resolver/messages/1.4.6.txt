Changes in 1.4.6
================

Bugfixes
--------

- "Show Conflict Files" now always opens the correct file, regardless of their location in the repository

Enhancements
------------

- If the plugin can't find the git executable, it will inform the user with an error dialog how he can tell Git Conflict Resolver about the path
- When running "Show Conflict Files" Git Conflict Resolver now tries to determine the git repository via the active view; if no view is opened, or the current view hasn't a file path, it uses the first opened folder to look for a repository
  If no folder is found the plugin gives up (why did run the command in that case anyway?)
- If the plugin is unable to find a git repository it will inform the user via the status bar

Enjoy!
